# Expectations {#id}
Below you will find details regarding my expectations as a major professor. Our mutual agreement to work together as advisor/advisee entails that you accept the conditions outlined throughout this document. Please remember that these expectations go both ways and that you should feel free to ask me about my approach to advisees.

Choosing a major professor is an important first step in completing your graduate education. Keep in mind that if you have not had a class with a particular faculty member, it is not likely that this professor will be a suitable advisor. In fact, if you have not had a class with me, DO NOT ask me to be your major professor; I will say no. In [Section](#Expectations), I have provided some questions that you might ask as you consider who your major professor might be. This decision will be different for MA and PhD students, though some of the same criteria may apply.

## Collaborative Research
For anyone considering asking me to be his/her major professor, you will be expected to participate in some type of collaborative research with me. Collaborative research could include, for example, a conference presentation, a publication, or a joint grant application. MA students who choose to complete a thesis will be strongly encouraged to choose a research topic that complements my own research agenda. In linguistics, working with collaborative projects has become increasingly common, and I encourage this type of work with all my students. You should take advantage of your time as a graduate student to learn how to work on group research.

## Presenting papers/posters
In addition to working with me collaboratively, I expect you to present your research (either individually, with me, or in collaboration with other scholars) in academic settings. The first place to do so is at the **Romance Linguistics Colloquium** (held year-round) and the **Linguistics Colloquium** (held on Fridays in the Spring semester), each featuring talks by students and sometimes faculty from UGA and other institutions. Any student, MA or PhD, working with me is expected to give at least one presentation in the RLC related to his/her thesis/dissertation research; **this is not optional**. Moreover, there are a number of conferences that would be good venues for your work, e.g., the *Hispanic Linguistics Colloquium*, *Workshop on Spanish Sociolinguistics*, *Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages*, *Southeastern Conference on Languages and Literatures*, *New Ways of Analyzing Variation*, *Annual LSA Meeting*, among many others. Presenting at academic conferences is one of the best ways to meet other students and faculty interested in your topic and to get feedback on your research. UGA has a number of resources available to students attending conferences, including departmental funds and Graduate School support.

## Teaching
If you are a graduate assistant at UGA, you will have a number of duties related to the teaching of your classes. Although I won't have a supervisory role in your teaching, I'm happy to offer advice as needed, such as it is. During each semester, my intention is to observe your teachoing at least once, just to have an idea of your teaching style so that I can address this in my letters of recommendation. Also, if you'd like for me to attend a class or would like to sit in on one of mind, just let me know. I've learned a lot about teaching from watching my students and am always looking to learn new approaches.

You should also be prepared to treat your teaching (like your research) as another opportunity for professional development. As such, I highly recommend consulting with the [UGA Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.uga.edu/) which offers, among many other programs, a wide range of [opportunities for Graduate Students](https://ctl.uga.edu/grad-student/). Again, my primary focus regarding your education at UGA is helping you develop and execute a successful research program. But you should always look out for ways of improving your teaching.

## Submitting and Revising
At some point in your program (preferably sooner rather than later), I will give you a schedule specific to your program. This schedule will include dates for turning in different pieces of your MA thesis or dissertation. Regarding submission of materials, please keep in mind the following. Before any materials (in particular, chapters of a thesis or a dissertation) are submitted to the other members of your advisory committee, they will need to be approved by me. I will need to provide feedback on your work before you send it out to others. When you do submit something to me (and to others), it should be as polished as possible. **Do not** submit a set of bulleted notes and expect to get feedback. Finally, regarding turn-around times (see also section **section:SelectChair**), my goal is to give you feedback on your work **no later than two weeks after submission**. I will make every effort to get your work returned to you in a timely manner.

Also, you should feel free (and in fact obliged) to send me other submissions that you might be working on. In particular, I will be happy to read drafts of conference abstracts and journal/proceedings submissions. At the very least, you should have one other set of eyes reviewing your work before you send it out. I (and your committee members) will certainly be available to give you feedback on these items.

## Letters of Recommendation
I am more than happy to provide letters of recommendation for my advisees, including those for whom I am not the major professor. However, please keep in mind that preparing multiple letters requires a considerable amount of time, even if the content of these letters is largely repeated for different applications. Thus, for any given letter writing venture that requires more than **five (5)** individual letters (e.g., letters for academic positions), students will be expected to use a dossier service, like [Interfolio]( http://career.uga.edu/graduate_school/interfolio). This requirement applies to anyone (advisees and non-advisees) who may request that I provide a letter of recommendation.

All requests for letters should be done with **at least three weeks of advance notice**. More substantive letters (e.g., letters for job applications), require more time; please keep this in mind as you plan your requests. When you ask for a letter (or letters), I'll need the following:

1. Complete information about the program or job that you are applying for: This includes description of the job or the name of the specific degree program / study abroad program and a link to the program website, the name and address of the person to whom the letter should be sent [if it is not a standard online recommendation form, other special instructions concerning the letter, and the <font size="3" color="red">deadline</font>.
2. Copies of other documents that you may be submitting along with your application (e.g., a CV or resum√©, writing sample): These can be rough drafts. If you are applying for an academic position you must include a draft of your cover letter.
3. Names and dates for the courses you took with me along with some indication of the work that you did in theses courses (e.g., titles of final papers): This will help in making sure that my memory doesn't get in the way of providing helpful (and accurate) details in the letter.
4. Any additional information that might be useful: It's often the case that I make mention in my letters of extracurricular accomplishments. If you feel that there's something you'd like for me to address, then you should certainly provide me with additional materials.

Finally, I need to make two additional points regarding letters. First, unless you're certain that I can provide a generally positive letter, then you should reconsider asking me for one. The better I know you and your work, the more specific the letter will be. But if you don't believe that I will serve as a good or accurate recommender, then please ask someone else. Second, I welcome and appreciate ``Gentle Reminders'' as needed, particularly as a deadline approaches.

## Tech Savvy
In completing your thesis or dissertation, you should make every effort to learn new skills that will be useful to in field. This includes research skills (e.g., quantitative analysis), software, and equipment. Starting in **Fall 2020**, all advisees will be required to use the newly revised [UGA Dissertation LaTeX Template](https://github.com/DigiUGA/UGA-Dissertation-LaTeX-Template), developed by Joey Stanley and Jonathan Crum. There are lots of resources for learning how to use LaTeX, including some available through the [UGA DigiLab](https://digi.uga.edu/digilab/#1544564021635-6ae22572-cb2d). For the purposes of working with me as an advisee, knowledge of the following resources will be required:

1. **LaTeX**: As you will find out, there are plenty of ways to **LaTeX** (yes, it's a verb!). One particularly easy way is to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) which has a number of useful features that make getting started with **LaTeX** relatively easy. You can also **LaTeX** on your local machine (i.e. your laptop) using editors like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).
2. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (or some similar citation management system): Keeping track of what will end up being many references requires some tool designed for this purpose, especially since you will be using **LaTeX**. I recommend Zotero but there are others (e.g., Endnote).
3. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/): At this point, using R and RStudio are standard in the field. There are **numerous** books about using R in linguistics <!--(e.g., \citealt{gries_statistics_2013}, \citealt{desagulier_corpus_2017}, and \citealt{winter_statistics_2020}), in addition to other resources available for learning more about R.-->
4. [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan): This is an annotation tool for audio and video recordings created by the great folks at the [Language Archive](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/).

This (woefully inadequate) list should provide you with a sense of my expectations regarding the skills you should be learning. There will be many other resources that will be useful as you navigate your research and teaching interests. If you have no background in coding or using programs like these, welcome to the club.  Remember that now is the time for you to expose yourself to as many new ideas and techniques as possible. Take this time to push yourself into new areas, even it requires moving out of your tech-comfort zone. I strongly encourage you to interact with me and your fellow students in learning more about these resources. If you would like for me (or someone else) to arrange a workshop that covers any of these resources, I am more than happy to do that.

# Academic Requirements

## MA Students

For information regarding the MA in Hispanic Linguistics, please read carefully both the [Degree Requirements](http://www.rom.uga.edu/ma-hispanic-linguistics) and the [Romance Languages Graduate Handbook](http://www.rom.uga.edu/graduate-handbook), in particular [section III.2](http://www.rom.uga.edu/graduate-handbook#III2). This section provides a ``Suggested Timetable to Complete the M.A. program'', which is normally done in two years. For students in the Department of Linguistics, you should read the information regarding the [MA (thesis)](https://ling.franklin.uga.edu/graduate/ma-thesis-introduction) or [MA (non-thesis)](https://ling.franklin.uga.edu/graduate/ma-non-thesis-introduction). The [Checklist in Section III.2.g](http://www.rom.uga.edu/graduate-handbook#III2) explains the specific requirements for completion of the MA, most of which apply both to students in Romance Languages and  Linguistics. Students from the Department of Linguistics should also consult the website regarding [Graduate Advising](http://linguistics.uga.edu/graduate-advising) as well as the [Linguistics Graduate Student Handbook](https://ling.franklin.uga.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Graduate%20Handbook%20Revised%20Feb%202020.pdf). In addition to this information, you should also consider the following:

- **All** linguistics students (regardless of their particular areas of interest) should complete the [Internal Review Board (IRB) training](http://www.ovpr.uga.edu/hso/training/) required for working with human subjects. Ideally, you should do this during your **first semester**.
- If you're planning to do fieldwork or experiments, I strongly urge you to apply for funding (see Section **part:Funding**). Even if you don't receive any funds, the experience of applying will be beneficial.
- Even though studying or working in the summer is not strictly speaking required, it is an ideal time to complete data collection or experiment development/implementation. In fact, taking courses over the summer can be a good way to get a jump on your coursework. In addition to occasional offerings from Romance Languages, the Statistics Department routinely offers **STAT 6210/6220 and 6315**, both of which offer students comprehensive coverage of the types of quantitative methods used in linguistic research. For a more specific introduction, however, I strongly recommend that students take \textbf{LING 4400/6400}, "Quantitative Methods in Linguistics."
- Students working with me, as either MA or PhD students, will be *required* to present their research at some forum held on campus, such as the Romance Languages Colloquium or the Linguistics Colloquium. MA students will be expected to present in the fall or spring of their second year.

Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of theses that I have directed:^[For an exhaustive list of the theses I've directed, along with abstracts, see the [Student Section of my personal website for more examples](https://chadhoweuga.github.io/chowe/students/}{Student Section of my personal website for more examples)].

- **Ryan Dekker** (MA, Linguistics), Thesis Title: *Income Effects on a Speech Community: Oconee County within Northeastern Georgia* (2018)
- **Bethany Bateman** (MA, Romance Languages), Thesis Title: *Reportative evidentiality in Wounaan meu-Spanish bilinguals: A comparative examination of* dice(n) que (2015)
- **Philip Limerick** (MA, Romance Languages), Thesis Title: *Spanish subject expression in Roswell, Georgia: Dialect formation in an emerging bilingual community* (2014)
- **Kristen Fredriksen** (MA, Linguistics), Thesis Title: *Constraints on perfect auxiliary contraction: Evidence from spoken American English* (2012)
- **Kerry Steinberg** (MA, Romance Languages), Thesis Title: *Language Use, Language Attitudes and Mobility: The Case of the Rural and Urban Areas of Coronel Oviedo, Paraguay* (2010)
- **William Pennington** (MA, Romance Languages), Thesis Title: *Split antecedents and pronominal expressions in Spanish* (2008)
- **Ninosca P√©rez Minchola** (MA, Romance Languages, Thesis Title: *El rol de la cortes\'ia en entrevistas pol√≠ticas conflictivas en la televisi√≥n peruana* (2007)


### A note on Thesis vs. Non-Thesis

The choice between doing the thesis or the non-thesis option of the MA is one that should be guided largely by your experiences in your first semester (or two) at UGA. After arriving at UGA, you should talk to your professors and get an idea of what you might be able to do for thesis research. Keep in mind that you're not necessarily expected to come up with a thesis topic completely on your own. Ideally, your research would relate to/interface with/contribute to the work being conducted by the faculty in the department. If you're considering moving onto a PhD after the MA, you should consider your decision of doing a thesis very carefully. Although the trend as of late seems to be that MA programs in Spanish Linguistics (and some in General Linguistics) do not require a thesis, completing a thesis-like project can be a good way of gauging your interest and ability in the field. Moreover, since the idea of a thesis is to have you produce a piece of research that is of sufficient quality to present at academic conferences and to publish in scholarly journals, then this work could be used as part of your application to PhD programs (should you be interested in pursuing a career in academics). In short, I urge you to keep your options open; you never know when you might be struck by inspiration and decide that research on the complex nature of variable past reference in Spanish is indeed your true calling.

## PhD Students

So, you've decided to do a PhD. You will likely find yourself in the position of asking yourself (and having others ask you) "Why are you doing this?". This is normal and will continue throughout your career in academia. The more relevant question to ask yourself at this point is "How am I going to get this done?". For students in Romance Languages, you should consult the [Degree Requirements for the PhD in Hispanic Linguistics](http://www.rom.uga.edu/ph-d-hispanic-linguistics) as well as the [relevant sections of the RL Graduate Student Handbook](http://www.rom.uga.edu/graduate-handbook#III3). Once again, you should pay close attention to the sections outlining the Suggested Timetable (III.3.g) and the Checklist (III.3.h). For students in the Department of Linguistics, you should consult the following information provided in [this section of the departmental website](https://ling.franklin.uga.edu/graduate/phd-introduction}{this section of the departmental website).

Like any life choice, choosing to do a PhD should be approached with considerable care and preparation. There are **many** resources on the internet regarding this question, and I would suggest going through them before you commit. It's also a good idea to take a look at resources like the *Chronicle of Higher Education*, which has resources regarding the academic job market. I also recommend a document entitled [How to Be a Successful PhD Student](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~wallach/how_to_be_a_successful_phd_student.pdf) (by Mark Dredze at Johns Hopkins University and Hanna M. Wallach University of Massachusetts Amherst). In addition to many other helpful comments, Dredze and Wallach note that "[g]etting a PhD takes a long time and a great deal of dedication and hard work. Unless you really want it, you will not finish the PhD." A healthy dose of practical consideration is helpful before embarking on a program of doctoral study.

Here are a few things you have to keep in mind if you're considering doing a PhD in general and with me more specifically:

- As mentioned in section **part:Expectations**, you should make every effort during your doctoral studies to expose yourself to new ideas. This includes (but is not limited to) attending lectures, learning new research techniques/methods, engaging in collaborative research with faculty and other students, and taking courses (when possible) that are not necessarily required by your program of study.
- Students working with me, as either MA or PhD students, will be **required** to present their research at the Romance Languages Colloquium and the Linguistics Colloquium. MA students will be expected to present in the fall or spring of their second year. PhD students will present at least once in the RLC.
- Applying for funds to conduct research is part and parcel of what you'll be doing in academics. And though getting a research grant is time-consuming and often frustrating, it is absolutely essential to your formation as a scholar to solicit funding for your work. In section **part:Funding**, I explain some of the resources available for research funding. Please have a look at these resources. If you know of any that aren't included, feel free to let me know.
- As a PhD student, you will be focusing more and more on an exceptionally small piece of the larger realm of scholarly exploration. However, this is not an excuse to avoid taking courses in other linguistic disciplines (or even from other areas of the humanities or social sciences). Indeed, some of the best research is conducted at the interfaces between areas of study (e.g., linguistics and sociology) and should be considered as viable areas of inquiry. However ...
- If you find yourself interested in some topic that you know to be well outside my wheelhouse (which includes a lot of issues), it's probably better that you ask someone else to be your Major Professor. More generally, you should know what the interests of your potential advisor and committee members are so that you can begin to plan your thesis project accordingly.
- Invest some effort in reading about how to accomplish your degree objectives. Some oldies but goodies include <!-- \cite{bolker_writing_1998} and \cite{macaulay_surviving_2011}, but there are many others. -->

# Program Requirements {.tabset}

If you're planning on asking me to be your Major Professor, you will be required to meet the following deadlines. **Failure to meet these deadlines may result in the postponement of the completion of your degree or termination of your program**.

## MA Students

1. *Choose a major professor*: If you're planning to ask me to direct your thesis, you need to make this request no later than <font size="3" color="red">the end of your 2nd semester</font>the end of your 2nd semester} (Important dates are indicated in red.). You should first take some time to come and talk to me to discuss the type of project you're interested in doing.
2. *Selecting a thesis topic*: This, of course, can be done in conjunction with the selection of your Major Professor. If you are working with me, you will need to submit, in writing, a proposed thesis topic (2 pages) no later than <font size="3" color="red">the end of your 2nd (MA) semester</font>.
3. *Apply for funding, IRB, etc. for MA Thesis-related projects*: If your project requires data collection with human subjects (e.g., interviews, experiments, etc.), you will need to submit the required paperwork to the [IRB] (https://research.uga.edu/hrpp/irb/). Also, if you need to travel, you should apply for funding during your <font size="3" color="red">2nd semester</font>.
4. *Selection of Advisory Committee*: There's a good chance that you will have already chosen the other members of your Advisory Committee. If not, we'll need to finalize your selection by the end of your <font size="3" color="red">2nd semester</font>.
5. *Complete fieldwork*: If you plan on working with me, chances are that you'll be asked to gather data of your own. So, you should plan on completing this part of your thesis research during the summer between your <font size="3" color="red">1st Spring semester and your 2nd Fall Semester</font>.
6. *Pass M.A. Examinations*

#### MA in ROML {-}
"The M.A. written examinations will be given three times a year: in the <font size="3" color="red">2nd week of November</font>; in the <font size="3" color="red">5th week of the Spring Semester</font>; and in <font size="3" color="red">the 12th week of the Spring Semester</font>. Students choosing to write a thesis must take the M.A. written examinations in November. The examination in the 5th week of the Spring Semester will be reserved for students choosing the non-thesis option and students who failed the exam in November. The examination in the 12th week of Spring Semester will be reserved for students who failed the examination in the 5th week of Spring Semester. The Graduate Coordinator will inform students in writing of the date of the exams and ask them in turn to inform him or her of their intention to take the exam. Previous exam questions will be kept on file and made available to students."

#### MA in Linguistics {-}
For Masters students in the Department of Linguistics, there are also two options: [M.A. (Thesis)](https://www.linguistics.uga.edu/ma-thesis-introduction) and [M.A. (Non-Thesis)](https://www.linguistics.uga.edu/ma-non-thesis-introduction). The Thesis option does not require an exam, but the Non-Thesis option does. For more information regarding the Final Examination for M.A. (non-thesis) Students, please consult [the departmental website](https://www.linguistics.uga.edu/ma-non-thesis-final-exam).

7. *File appropriate paperwork*: There are a number of steps that are involved in moving towards completing your requirements for the M.A., some of which will be accomplished in the Spring Semester of your 2nd year (e.g., Application for Graduation). One of the forms that should be completed by the end of your 3rd semester is the Program of Study Form. See the [Graduate School Website](https://grad.uga.edu/index.php/current-students/forms/) for more details.
8. *Secure approval of thesis prospectus*: For MA students in ROML, you must prepare a prospectus outlining your thesis research and describing the main points that will be discussed (see section III.2.d. of the Handbook). This prospectus will be read by your Advisory Committee and discussed following your MA examinations. You must submit a complete draft of your prospectus <font size="3" color="red">the end of your third semester</font> (i.e. in December). Although there is no formal requirement of a prospectus for MA students in the Department of Linguistics, you will be required to prepare a proposal if you are working with me. A draft of this proposal must be submitted by <font size="3" color="red">the end of your third semester</font>.
9. *Submit 1st Draft of your thesis*: You will need to turn in a complete draft of your thesis (i.e. one that includes the body of the document, the bibliography, tables, etc., not just a collection of notes) by the beginning of your last semester in the program. The expectation is that uyou will be submitting chapters of your thesis before this time. These chapters will be reviewed by me and your other committee members (see section III.2.d. of the Graduate Student handbook). The complete draft should be submitted by the <font size="3" color="red">last Friday of January of your final semester</font>.
10. *Submit 1st Draft of your thesis*: You will need to turn in a complete draft of your thesis (i.e. one that includes the body of the document, the bibliography, tables, etc., not just a collection of notes) by the beginning of your last semester in the program. The expectation is that uyou will be submitting chapters of your thesis before this time. These chapters will be reviewed by me and your other committee members (see section III.2.d. of the Graduate Student handbook). The complete draft should be submitted by the <font size="3" color="red">last Friday of January of your final semester</font>.
11. *Submit revised draft of thesis*: The revising process takes time and will undoubtedly require several passes. You will be expected to have finished a complete revised draft no later than <font size="3" color="red">the end of February</font>.
12. *Schedule a defense*: All the final paperwork required for your graduation is due by the last week in April (see [Graduate School Deadlines](https://grad.uga.edu/index.php/current-students/important-dates-deadlines/). In order to provide proper time for any necessary revisions between your defense date and the date for completing all degree-related requirements, we will plan to have your defense in <font size="3" color="red">early to mid April</font>. This should provide you with ample time to apply any of the changes resulting from the defense and review by your Advisory Committee.
13. *Submit Thesis Draft for Review by Advisory Committee*: You will need to submit the 'final' version of your thesis to your committee <font size="3" color="red">no later than two weeks before the defense date</font>. This is done to provide your advisory committee enough time to provide comments and feedback on the final product. Also, it is at this point that your committee will sign (or not) the ["Approval for Master's Thesis and Final Oral Examination"](http://www.grad.uga.edu/forms&publications/student/body_apprform.pdf) for your thesis.
14. *Format Check for Graduate School*: See the [Graduate School website](http://www.grad.uga.edu/academics/deadlines.html) for more details.
